//QNo. 22: If you haven't received an array index error, try to happen one. Make sure you know how to correct the code before running it.
let error1 = [`GIAIC`, `PIAIC`, `GU TECH`];
//accessing index of array
console.log(error1[4]);
// It show undefined in terminal because array index [4] doesn't exist in the code.
//Let's define what to correct..
console.log(error1[0]);
// it shows GIAIC because array starts from index 0 and GIAIC is on that idex which comes in console.
